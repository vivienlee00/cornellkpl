                </header>

                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Hello! My name is Angie Lee, and I am the current President of the iota
                  Chapter of Kappa Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. at Cornell University. Our organization was founded in
                  1995 on the pillars of sisterhood, service, and cultural diversity and is the fastest growing
                  Asian-interest sorority currently represented at 33 schools with over 4,000 sisters nationwide.
                  Kappa Phi Lambda is a vast network of intelligent women aspiring in diverse fields and is a resource
                  center filled with endless opportunities upon graduation. To us, the sisters of the iota Chapter,
                  Kappas is the invisible bond supporting individuals through life challenges and self-discovery.
                  It is a house built on friendship, respect, and a shared vision.
                  <br><br>

                  My ongoing journey with Kappas has been one filled with tremendous personal growth. Through this
                  amazing sorority, I have been able to extend a helping hand to the community through works of
                  philanthropy
                  and service while expanding my social and professional skills. I have also met the most selfless,
                  hardworking, and supportive group of women who constantly strive to make those around them better.
                  Our sisters‚Äô unique strengths and altruistic actions inspire me to always be my best self and pursue
                  my passions with courage and resilience. <br><br>

                  I can confidently say that Kappas has infinitely enriched my college experience, and I encourage you
                  to learn more about our wonderful organization. Feel free to explore our website, like our Facebook
                  page,

                  that
                  myself and all my sisters share for Kappas.<br><br>

                </header>

                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Seven women established the Kappa Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. at Binghamton
                  University on March 9, 1995 with a single vision of sisterhood, service, and cultural diversity. The
                  sorority was conceived to provide a culturally and educationally inspiring grounding for Asian
                  American women, laying the cornerstones of what was to become a revolutionary and unprecedented
                  organization. This culturally based sorority would unite women of differing heritages and encourage
                  use of their strong voices and thought. This sorority is open to women of all nationalities and
                  backgrounds who want to learn about, actively speak for, and represent Pan-Asian culture. These first
                  sisters of Kappa Phi Lambda also extended their hands to the community through charitable works of
                  both service-oriented and philanthropic natures. Kappa Phi Lambda formed to provide the campus, and,
                  on a large scale, the society with yet another option for learning and another outlet for activity.
                  Several years ago, seven beautiful women lit the fire that is Kappa Phi Lambda and watched it grow.
                  That fire now burns brightly within each of its present sisters, carrying with it all of our
                  individual aspects, and it will continue to burn within the sisters to come.</p>

                </header>

                <p style="font-size: 15px;">In the spring of 2000, seven women, not satisfied with the existing
                  opportunities available to enhance their personal growth and to contribute to the campus and community
                  through Asian-awareness and service, brought Kappa Phi Lambda to Cornell University. Through their
                  dedication and hard work, these remarkable women established a cultural sorority with a vision of a
                  united sisterhood fostering leadership and academic excellence. Their legacy continues with the
                  following generations of sisters as they continue their philanthropic efforts, hoping to inspire the
                  community to help make a difference. We fundraise for charitable foundations such as the Woman‚Äôs
                  Advocacy Center so that they may continue providing free services, support, and educational programs
                  for women and children who have encountered sexual abuse and harassment, abusive relationships or
                  domestic violence. Every year, Kappa Phi Lambda brings to campus a variety of events that raises
                  awareness and addresses issues concerning Asian culture and women by way of workshops, guest speakers,
                  and discussion panels. Meanwhile, we recognize those on campus who share common values and goals
                  through collaboration with their organizations and support of their events. Each sister sacrifices
                  hours of her time to help better the environment around her by participating in community service. In
                  the past, we‚Äôve combined efforts with volunteer organizations such as Habitat for Humanity and On-site
                  Volunteers so that we can create a larger and lasting impact on our community.

                <h5>SISTERHOOD</h5>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">We believe that there is only one thing stronger than a diamond and that is
                  sisterhood. We embrace the fact that each one of our sisters is different and through sisterhood, we
                  get to share our diverse values, cultures, beliefs and learn from one another. With our eternal care
                  for each other, we create friendships that last beyond campus and our college years. Through all of
                  the highs and lows of life, our sisters can always depend on one another, whether it's simply sharing
                  a laugh together or supporting each other through difficult times. We may all come from different
                  walks of life but through sisterhood, we unite as together one entity: Kappa Phi Lambda.</p>

                <h5>SERVICE</h5>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">As an organization, we find it important to take the time to give back to
                  our immediate community on Cornell‚Äôs campus, the greater Ithaca community, as well as our national and
                  local philanthropies. The pillar of service empowers our sisters to take action and move a step
                  towards making a difference on current critical issues, such as socioeconomic and gender inequality
                  and domestic violence. We continue to strive to spread the act of service and support organizations
                  that focus on tackling these national issues. Our chapter is proud of voicing our opinions and putting
                  our passionate perspectives into actions for the communities we can impact.</p>

                <h5>CULTURAL DIVERSITY</h5>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">As an Asian interest organization, Kappa Phi Lambda is vested with both the
                  power and responsibility to promote understanding, education, and awareness of Asian and
                  Asian-American culture. Through the various events that sisters host and attend each year, such as
                  Asia Night, Spirit of the Phoenix, and the Mid-Autumn Festival, we strive to build a community around
                  cultural diversity. Furthermore, Kappa Phi Lambda‚Äôs status as a Multicultural Greek Fraternal
                  organization enhances our ability to build relationships with other multi-cultural Greek
                  organizations. In the current political climate, we feel it is particularly important for minorities
                  to support one another and together promote diversity.</p>

            </header>
            <p style="font-size: 16px;">Philanthropy is a very important aspect of Kappa Phi Lambda. Since our
              establishment, we have succeeded in our many efforts to raise money and donate to a variety of
              organizations. Kappa Phi Lambda‚Äôs national philanthropy is CARE (Cooperative for Assistance and Relief
              Everywhere). CARE is an international humanitarian organization working to fight global poverty, and it
              focuses on working with women to improve basic education, end gender-based violence, provide healthcare
              and nutrition, increase access to clean water and sanitation, expand economic opportunity, protect natural
              resources, and deliver emergency aid to survivors of war and natural disasters. For more information about
              CARE, please visit their website at care.org.</p>

                </header>

                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Hello! My name is Angie Lee, and I am the current President of the iota
                  Chapter of Kappa Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. at Cornell University. Our organization was founded in
                  1995 on the pillars of sisterhood, service, and cultural diversity and is the fastest growing
                  Asian-interest sorority currently represented at 33 schools with over 4,000 sisters nationwide.
                  Kappa Phi Lambda is a vast network of intelligent women aspiring in diverse fields and is a resource
                  center filled with endless opportunities upon graduation. To us, the sisters of the iota Chapter,
                  Kappas is the invisible bond supporting individuals through life challenges and self-discovery.
                  It is a house built on friendship, respect, and a shared vision.
                  <br><br>

                  My ongoing journey with Kappas has been one filled with tremendous personal growth. Through this
                  amazing sorority, I have been able to extend a helping hand to the community through works of
                  philanthropy
                  and service while expanding my social and professional skills. I have also met the most selfless,
                  hardworking, and supportive group of women who constantly strive to make those around them better.
                  Our sisters‚Äô unique strengths and altruistic actions inspire me to always be my best self and pursue
                  my passions with courage and resilience. <br><br>

                  I can confidently say that Kappas has infinitely enriched my college experience, and I encourage you
                  to learn more about our wonderful organization. Feel free to explore our website, like our Facebook
                  page,
                  and visit our Instagram! I hope I have sparked in you a flame of curiosity that may grow into a love
                  that
                  myself and all my sisters share for Kappas.<br><br>

                </header>

                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Seven women established the Kappa Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. at Binghamton
                  University on March 9, 1995 with a single vision of sisterhood, service, and cultural diversity. The
                  sorority was conceived to provide a culturally and educationally inspiring grounding for Asian
                  American women, laying the cornerstones of what was to become a revolutionary and unprecedented
                  organization. This culturally based sorority would unite women of differing heritages and encourage
                  use of their strong voices and thought. This sorority is open to women of all nationalities and
                  backgrounds who want to learn about, actively speak for, and represent Pan-Asian culture. These first
                  sisters of Kappa Phi Lambda also extended their hands to the community through charitable works of
                  both service-oriented and philanthropic natures. Kappa Phi Lambda formed to provide the campus, and,
                  on a large scale, the society with yet another option for learning and another outlet for activity.
                  Several years ago, seven beautiful women lit the fire that is Kappa Phi Lambda and watched it grow.
                  That fire now burns brightly within each of its present sisters, carrying with it all of our
                  individual aspects, and it will continue to burn within the sisters to come.</p>

                </header>

                <p style="font-size: 15px;">In the spring of 2000, seven women, not satisfied with the existing
                  opportunities available to enhance their personal growth and to contribute to the campus and community
                  through Asian-awareness and service, brought Kappa Phi Lambda to Cornell University. Through their
                  dedication and hard work, these remarkable women established a cultural sorority with a vision of a
                  united sisterhood fostering leadership and academic excellence. Their legacy continues with the
                  following generations of sisters as they continue their philanthropic efforts, hoping to inspire the
                  community to help make a difference. We fundraise for charitable foundations such as the Woman‚Äôs
                  Advocacy Center so that they may continue providing free services, support, and educational programs
                  for women and children who have encountered sexual abuse and harassment, abusive relationships or
                  domestic violence. Every year, Kappa Phi Lambda brings to campus a variety of events that raises
                  awareness and addresses issues concerning Asian culture and women by way of workshops, guest speakers,
                  and discussion panels. Meanwhile, we recognize those on campus who share common values and goals
                  through collaboration with their organizations and support of their events. Each sister sacrifices
                  hours of her time to help better the environment around her by participating in community service. In
                  the past, we‚Äôve combined efforts with volunteer organizations such as Habitat for Humanity and On-site
                  Volunteers so that we can create a larger and lasting impact on our community.

                      is sisterhood. We embrace the fact that each one of our sisters is different and through

                      our eternal care for each other, we create friendships that last beyond campus and our college
                      years. Through all of the highs and lows of life, our sisters can always depend on one another,
                      whether it's simply sharing a laugh together or supporting each other through difficult times. We

                      gender inequality and domestic violence. We continue to strive to spread the act of service and

                      around cultural diversity. Furthermore, Kappa Phi Lambda‚Äôs status as a Multicultural Greek
                      Fraternal organization enhances our ability to build relationships with other multi-cultural Greek
                      organizations. In the current political climate, we feel it is particularly important for
                      minorities to support one another and together promote diversity.</p>

              </header>
              <p style="font-size: 16px;">Philanthropy is a very important aspect of Kappa Phi Lambda. Since our
                establishment, we have succeeded in our many efforts to raise money and donate to a variety of
                organizations. Kappa Phi Lambda‚Äôs national philanthropy is CARE (Cooperative for Assistance and Relief
                Everywhere). CARE is an international humanitarian organization working to fight global poverty, and it
                focuses on working with women to improve basic education, end gender-based violence, provide healthcare
                and nutrition, increase access to clean water and sanitation, expand economic opportunity, protect
                natural resources, and deliver emergency aid to survivors of war and natural disasters. For more
                information about CARE, please visit their website at care.org.</p>

              The iota chapter of Kappa Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. is a member of the Multicultural Greek and Fraternal
              Council (MGFC) at Cornell University. The MGFC is a member of the Greek Tri-Council along with the
              Interfraternity Council (IFC) and the Panhellenic Council. MGFC is composed of 16 culturally-based
              fraternities and sororities that coordinates programs promoting service and culture between members of an
              organization, members of the council, and the rest of the community.
              <br><br>
              The mission of this council is to operate as a united governing body for all organizations, dedicating
              themselves to promoting unity and serving as a support system. They will serve as a model for the
              underrepresented student community and operate as a united body to effectively advocate the issues and
              concerns of the organizations and the entire campus community that they serve. The purpose of MGFC is to
              positively promote cultural Greek Life as it exists at Cornell University and beyond.
